I walked into a bus tunnel and heard the entire space GROWL 

I’ve read that haunted places are filled with low frequencies that bounce off the walls until they are only felt by the body. 

The roar of a lion also contains this low rumbling sound.

The lack of sound can itself be a sound.

Some sounds I like:

●	Wind blowing through the side of the city that goes unnoticed
●	The clink of silverware in a fancy restaurant
●	An apple falling from a tree and hitting a ground covered in leaves
●	The scream of a truck engine
●	Making a guitar sing

I take classes Emerson College where I study Visual Media Arts.

There I hope to find projects to apply different sounds in different forms of media:

    Film                                 Web Design                           Art                        Movement

My favorite thing is to walk around with a shotgun microphone and headphones.

It picks up a lot of cool individual sounds you wouldn’t have noticed otherwise.

There was an air conditioner down some stairs that sounded like wind on mountains.

I am currently making a program that reads hand movements and translates them into sound using the XBox Kinect.
